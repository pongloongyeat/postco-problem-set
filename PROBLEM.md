# Software Engineer Problem Set

Thank you for your interest in PostCo. We truly appreciate the time and effort you have taken to make an application. We like what we have seen so far, and we are curious to see more of how you work.

For this, we have designed a problem set to test how you use your programming knowledge to solve real world problems. It involves basic understanding of data structures and your creativity in problem solving.

In designing this problem set, we will try to simulate how engineers work in real world environment. That means that you can use the amazing world wide web if you find it useful. Also, keep in mind that whatever you find on the internet might not be the best or most creative solution you can use.

We will evaluate you based on different things but not limited to this list:

- Resourcefulness: how good you are at finding tools that can help you out.
- Creativity: how creative you are at problem solving.
- Communication: how good you are at communicating your solution and explaining why.
- Fun: how fun you are to work with.

## Understanding the Problem Set

Faris is a thriving PostCo agent and owner of Tapir Grocer, an artisanal grocery shop in Taman Tun. After the recent pandemic event, contact tracing has become essential and many apps have been developed for this. Instead of relying on these solutions, Faris decided to hire you to build a custom solution for Tapir Grocer.

### A. Government requirements

The app you build for Faris must comply with the following government requirements:

- Visitors can check in when visiting Tapir Grocer.
- When they check in, the app will capture the visitor's full name, NRIC number, body temperature, date, and time.

### B. Product owner requirements

However, Faris sees this as a business opportunity to make the app available to his friends and community. For this, the app should also have these features:

- Location owners can sign up with the app and generate a link to display to their visitors.
- When visitors visit this link, they can check in per the requirements in A.

### C. Extra credits

The app is now complete and usable, but Faris wants the best experience for his visitors. It would be nice if the app can improve the visitor experience, for example:

- Instead of typing the URL into their browser, visitors can quickly open the check in link.
- After checking in for the first time, visitors no longer need to fill up the same details and can check in even more quickly.

## Programming Language and Framework

You may use any programming language for this Problem Set. We encourage you to use a web development framework, like Ruby on Rails, so that you don't have to build everything from scratch and can focus on solving the business requirements.

## Submission

Create a public repository on GitHub and send the link over to us at [tech@postco.co](mailto:tech@postco.co). Please also include instructions on how to get the app running.

## Additional Notes

Building all these features may not be possible for everyone, since we all have commitments in life. We definitely will not be impressed if you lose sleep over what we hope will be a fun assignment.

Please prioritise what you think is important for Faris (he's very reasonable). The reason we put in the possible features is just to give you an idea of what business requirements are like, weigh the cost of implementing them, and decide if they are worth it.

We can't wait to see what you build!
